# Dataset

This directory contains a partial dataset used for the experiments and evaluation in the paper. Due to the large size of the full dataset (~120GB), only a subset of example data and metadata is released here. The complete dataset can be obtained by running the collection scripts or following the methods described in the paper.

- `samples/`: Example scam app samples (anonymized/de-identified)
- `metadata/`: Dataset metadata, labels, and statistics

> **Note:** To request access to the full dataset for academic purposes, please contact the authors after the project is fully open-sourced. For details, refer to the main README.
